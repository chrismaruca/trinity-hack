                        <p>
                            Upon entrance into the competition, teams weren’t told directly what they’d be put up against.
                            However, we were given clues; most notably, we were given a scenario where “bruin engineers” are 
                            trapped in a space which could be dark and subject to high temperatures, seismic activity (shaking), 
                            as well as gas leaks and potential enemies. With this information in mind, we reasoned that the 
                            sensors/electronics mentioned below would serve us in the following ways:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-weight:bold">Gas sensor: </span>
                                Given the direct hint that there would be “gas leaks”, we knew this sensor would be a necessity 
                                when it came to determining environmental gas safety when going in to rescue our fellow bruin-rescuees. 
                                While some could argue that the nose acts as a good sensory tool for determining toxic gas, it must be 
                                acknowledged that not all toxic gas can be easily smelled–especially if our e-Hero has a cold!
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <span style="font-weight:bold">Temperature & humidity sensor: </span>
                                Given the uncertain mission-prompt, we initially sought to prioritize the other sensors, and opted out of 
                                focusing on the temp/humidity sensor. To specify, we figured that in a scenario where there is fire or hot 
                                temperatures, our bodies (sensory info from skin) would give us indication of temperature, and thus this sensor 
                                was low priority at the beginning–especially because some of us were not familiar with I2C. However, after finding 
                                out more details about the actual testing method, we decided to include it. In retrospect, we could have reasoned 
                                that accurate information about temperature and humidity could have indeed helped us in terms of determining more 
                                details about the environmental gas safety, as moisture and temperature affect the behavior of fluids. With this 
                                information, a well-educated mission control team could do further analysis on the environmental gas safety.
                            </li>

                                <span style="font-weight:bold">Ultrasonic sensor: </span>
                                Alongside the Ring LED, we figured that including an ultrasonic sensor could help us both navigate “dark room” 
                                scenarios (to see if an object is obstructing us), as well as giving us long range data (≤13ft) about whether 
                                or not an enemy or fellow bruin rescuee is in front of us, given the scenario. Given more time and some stepper 
                                motors, we could have even used the glove as a stationary sentry device (one where the U.S. is attached to a stepper 
                                motor which scans the environment and feeds data back so that mission control and/or OLED can display a radar of our 
                                environment, like ones seen on boats).

                                <span style="font-weight:bold">Ring LED: </span>
                                Since we were unsure what “dark room” could mean in terms of testing, we decided to include the Ring LED in hopes that 
                                it would act as a flashlight to illuminate whatever “dark room” our e-Hero stepped foot in. However, once we got more 
                                details revealed, we realized it was not needed for that purpose, and included it in the glove for pure aesthetics

                                Could give the e-Hero live feedback from the Ultrasonic sensor about distance or indicate if the environment was too toxic 
                                to be in. (At the start, we were unsure whether or not we could relay data from multiple sensors to the OLED, but after 
                                discovering we could, we opted to include data from all sensors in a readable format).

                                <span style="font-weight:bold">Website related: </span>
                                We used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to format our website and make it function. The first order of importance 
                                was making sure that the website was able to receive the data from the ESP32, which we accomplished quickly thanks to the code 
                                provided by Austin. Another important piece of code in the website is the code that handles interpreting the data that is 
                                received from the ESP32. We did this using JavaScript’s MutationObserver, which checks for whenever a portion of the website 
                                is changed. One last important feature are the slideshows, which required portions of code in all three of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                                to function. Once those three parts were out of the way, most of the other improvements and iterations on the site were aesthetic 
                                (backgrounds, positioning, et cetera).

                                The Arduino code is mainly functional, reading values from sensors and parsing them to suit our needs. The only code relating to aesthetics in the Arduino is for the OLED screen and ring LED. We knocked out the code that handled each sensor day by day, with us getting the ultrasonic sensor working on day 1, the temperature & humidity sensor on day 2, and the gas sensor on day 3. The most difficult thing to code in the Arduino was probably the aesthetic code for the OLED and LEDs because it required a lot of trial and error (with long compile times) and careful avoidance of any clashing with the functional code for the sensors.

                                We encountered many problems relating to CSS and HTML on the website, like elements not appearing for seemingly no reason, elements being the wrong size, random spacing after images, and other unexpected behavior. When these problems happened, we were able to push through by staying calm, diagnosing the problem as precisely as we could, and searching for a solution. One particular problem was that the images on the website had a random space under them. To diagnose the problem we carefully looked at the elements involved in displaying the images and eventually singled it out to the <img> element itself adding a space, which we found out was due to it having its display set to inline.

                                This being one of our first times working with the esp32 board it was a challenge to figure out the correct pins that would receive and output the correct data. Wiring everything was easier to figure out after multiple iterations, in the end we managed to color code all wires to the esp32 board with blue and yellow wires. Coding wise I referenced a lot of existing code online and had the help of my team to debug any problems I had. When one sensor failed, my previous knowledge from my intro to circuits class helped me to think there might be a shortage on the breadboard, which after staring at it for a good 10 minutes I managed to find the short and fix it to get all the sensors working together.

                        <p>Originally, our team wanted to prioritize functionality of the gauntlet over “cool factor”, especially because of the 48 hour constraint. We figured if we could reduce the risk in any department, and optimize time efficiency, we would be better off than the competition. Some aspects in pursuing this strategy were staying away from 3d printing, as each print carries with it both a risk of the print failing itself, as well as long print times (for designs which you sometimes cannot even verify if your idea works until after it has printed for a given duration) .Thus, we first opted for something which we could iterate upon, and chose a laser cut chassis with velcro straps on one side to secure it to the wrist; unfortunately, because there were only two velcro straps of minimal length, we had to come up with a design which secured the other non-velcroed side; it was this aspect which we had to iterate upon, especially for the “guide-rail” which can be seen in prototype one. The brackets and rail were both 3d-printed, which in itself grants room for sizing errors. As a solution, we 3d printed multiple cylinder sizes to test fit these brackets.  However, as can be seen, “prototype 1” was not our final gauntlet. Ironically, we ended up going for the 3d printed route after observing our competitors consistently printing complex and aesthetic designs without 3d-print failure. We attempted this aspect on day 2, which was in itself a risky choice, and luckily this prototype required very little iteration due to proper dimensioning and forecasting prior to printing</p>
